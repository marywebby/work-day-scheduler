# work-day-scheduler

DESCRIPTION

The following program provided is a very useful tool to help track and build your daily schedule as you move through your work day, making it so you can use the color coded hours to see what event is happing in present, what happened in the past, and what you have to look for forward to in the future. Another ascept to this program is that you are able to save your task in the correct hour bar, and then even when your refreash the page your task that you have saved, will still be in there! This challenge really gave me good practice in how to program 'for loops', and applying different css to differnt parts of code based off of the time of the day. It also really helped me in learning how to add the time and date to whatever project I am working on. 

USAGE

To begin, you will start by loading up the schedule builder in your web browser.
